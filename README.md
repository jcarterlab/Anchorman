# Anchorman

The mainstream media in the US is often said to have a liberal bias. This project investigates whether the 150,000 most recent twitter followers (as of May 19 2022) of the four largest US broadcasters (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) are more likely to be new followers of the Democrats or Republicans. It also checks whether these networks are more likely to tweet positively or negatively about the two political parties and popular politicians. As for Will Ferrellâ€™s character in Anchorman, there is a noticeable bias, but mainly among FOX and the Republicans.
