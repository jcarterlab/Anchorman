# Anchorman

It is often said that US media has a liberal bias. This project investigates whether the 150,000 most recent followers of the four largest broadcasters, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, are more likely to also be new followers of the Democrats or Republicans. Like Will Ferrell's character in Anchorman, the difference is not inconspicuous, but mainly among FOX's high number of Republicans.
