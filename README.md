# Anchorman

The mainstream media in the US is often said to have a liberal bias. This project investigates this by looking at political makeup of the 150,000 most recent twitter followers (as of May 19, 2022) of the four largest broadcasters (ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC) as well as the sentiment behind their most recent 3,200 tweets. Like for Will Ferrellâ€™s character in Anchorman, there is a noticeable bias, but mainly among FOX and the Republicans.
